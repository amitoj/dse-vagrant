This is a short vagrant configuration to provide a Datastax Enterprise Cluster with 3 nodes.
The goal was to not use any other applications like chef, ansible or puppet for configuration...

Developed this on my MacBook. Ensure that you have installed:

 - Virtualbox (with an Ubuntu Box)
 - Vagrant

and add your own password/username for Datastax Enterprise:
